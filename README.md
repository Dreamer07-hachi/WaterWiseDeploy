Project Abstract: 
This project seeks to combat urban India's water crisis with a smart water management web portal that addresses two issues. 
First, it provides a solution to household water waste. 
Second, it improves the unorganized market for water deliveries from tankers. 
The website enables users to simply track their water usage, specifically get notifications of possible leaks, and combines this with a trustworthy marketplace to find, book, and track water tankers supplied by verified providers at fair prices.
This solution combines these elements to ultimately support water conservation, efficiency, and accountability to the urban water supply chain.
